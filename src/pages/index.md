  title: Why StoryPurpose
  description: |
    As software continues to eat the world, organizations are undergoing digital transformation. In doing so, it becomes extremely important to ensure every effort put in digital adoption is eventually aligned with the organization's bigger purpose.

    StoryPurpose enables visualizing the smallest unit of deliverable (user story) in the bigger scheme of things

  As the backlog and the team size grows, it becomes difficult to track story breakup and prioritization.
  StoryPurpose provides fundamental tools to get a high level perspective of the story and
  how it aligns back to epic, team goals, initiative purpose, project purpose which in turn 
  should align back to overal organization mission.

        Once stories are conceptualized and prioritized it is important to be able to get detailed view of every related stories in a single workbench so that the delivery team does not need to switch multiple browser windows and struggle with corelating stories.

        1. List of issues in EPIC grouped by status
        2. Linked issues grouped by relationtype
        3. Task breakup if the selected issue
        4. Details of task breakup for every linked issue

      title: Release planning and storymapping
      text: |
        Depending upon the size of the epic and the related stories, it may not necessarily be possible to complete all stories in a single sprint or a release. Having a release-wise layout of the stories helps plan better deliveries.

        1. Release wise grouping of stories
        2. Stories by components
        3. Details dashboard based on status, issuetype and components
